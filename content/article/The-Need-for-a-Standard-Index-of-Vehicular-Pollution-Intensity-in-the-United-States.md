Abstract:

The Environmental Protection Agency is tasked with providing a guide to automobile consumers which indexes the smog output of a particular car and compares that car to others. The ratings system used is complicated and accounts for zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs) as well as large trucks and everything in between. Unfortunately, this convoluted structure leads to a complexity which is simply not practical from the standpoint of the end user.
