Hi! It's good to be posting again. Sorry about the old site going down! This is thrilling, though - the site you're viewing is hosted via a decentralized internet platform called the Interplanetary File System (or IPFS).

My name is Thomas Dylan Daniel, and I'm a Texan writer & philosopher. I'm a bit of a technologist, and I read a LOT. As I work on the site and get everything updated, (and learn more about how to use Hugo) I'll post tidbits here.

Cheers!
