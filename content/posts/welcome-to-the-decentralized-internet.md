Welcome to the Decentralized Internet.

In this life, there are few things more certain than change. This site, for example, used to be a Wordpress site hosted by a company with a server. It is still the primary website of an analytic philosopher, but everything else about it has...

...changed, recently.

<b>Today, in fact.</b>

Now, instead of being hosted by a single entity, this site is hosted by a "swarm" of "peers" (put in scare-quotes just to emphasized the novelty of the two concepts).

Here, you'll be able to follow along with the writings of a 21st century philosopher. Check out the top right corner of the site for links to social media.


That's all for now! Cheers!
