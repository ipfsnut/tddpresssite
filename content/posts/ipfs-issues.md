Hey everyone, it's only been a few days, but I'm still experimenting with IPFS here and we're finding some issues.

The biggest single problem seems to be the difficulty of keeping the site running and pinned so that it is accessible on the network.

It is also difficult to tell precisely how to link directly to content, such as this post. If I wanted to publish this new post to Facebook, I would have to include the site URL and instructions on how to navigate to it. Hugo's tendency to put newer content at the front of the blog helps with that some, but I'm not sure it's enough. I'll look for a way to reference a static part of the site over the next few days, but I believe the hyperlink structure lives in the IPFS code and can't be kicked out to the DNS the way a standard hosted site would be.


Coming soon: Raspberry Pi B+ IPFS server!

The project will be to develop a small module capable of running the IPFS daemon and pinning content to make it perpetually available. Perhaps this project will involve one or two of the little computers. I'm not sure what I'm going to do for monitors yet, or where I plan to keep them, but we'll get that figured out as we go.


Cheers!


Dylan
