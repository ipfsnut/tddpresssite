Hi! It's good to be posting again. Sorry about the old site going down! This is thrilling, though - the site you're viewing is hosted via a decentralized internet platform called the Interplanetary File System (or IPFS).

My name is Thomas Dylan Daniel, and I'm a Texan writer & philosopher. I'm a bit of a technologist, and I read a LOT. As I work on the site and get everything updated, (and learn more about how to use Hugo) I'll post tidbits here. This is a strange way to handle the 'about' section of the site, but it is called for by Hugo's tendency to treat every aspect of the website as a new blog category. Maybe at some point I'll discover a workaround for it, but for now it seems like an interesting enough call to simply deal with the About the Author section of the site as another running blog section.

Cheers!
