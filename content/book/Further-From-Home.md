<br>Abstract:

Further From Home is a collection of thought-provoking, puzzling short stories. The Zen purpose of the work is to provide the reader with a focus, in order to encourage awareness of the mystery, the magic, and the beauty of the world we share. Philosophical thinking is not only for libraries and scholars! Instead, everyday life - everyone's life - can be a rich, intriguing experience. The stories contain both success and failure, with no  overt indication of which is which. Each of them can be lightly enjoyed or deeply considered by the reader. Pushing beyond the typical limits of fictive storytelling, the book has a second purpose when taken as a whole. It is intended to walk the reader from a familiar, mundane place to an intriguing world  a bit further from home. The fictive mechanism allows the reader to empathize with people in strange situations, suspend disbelief, and accept the story being told without excessive argument. At the end of the book, these were all only short stories - yet it is certainly the authorâ€™s hope that the reader is able to use them to accomplish something more than simply reading a book.
