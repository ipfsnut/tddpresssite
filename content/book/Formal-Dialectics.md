Formal Dialectics is my first serious philosophy book. It ought to be out later this year - I'll post some review snippets and a blurb for it closer to launch.

<br><strong>Abstract:</strong>

Why do the attempts we make to explain the world around us fall short? Arguments for or against the existence of God, the question of free will, and even Principia Mathematica are all examples of explanations that look solid from some points of view, but which have serious weaknesses from other perspectives. This book explores the built-in limits of reason itself by pointing out the fact that language can only be used to create incomplete systems. Philosophy, mathematics, and logic supply the groundwork for the introduction of a framing mechanism to help thinkers understand why thinking itself can sometimes fail. Known as the metadialectic, this new frame of reference allows us to evaluate different arguments in terms of their constituent parts. Students from any background interested in improving critical thinking can benefit from this study of the dialectical archetypesâ€”as can the more traditional philosophically minded questioners, the ones of us who are motivated by a deeper desire to understand the world.
