      <description>Hey everyone, it&amp;rsquo;s only been a few days, but I&amp;rsquo;m still experimenting with IPFS here and we&amp;rsquo;re finding some issues.
The biggest single problem seems to be the difficulty of keeping the site running and pinned so that it is accessible on the network.
It is also difficult to tell precisely how to link directly to content, such as this post. If I wanted to publish this new post to Facebook, I would have to include the site URL and instructions on how to navigate to it.</description>

      <description>You may be wondering what on earth IPFS is. I’ve been very excited to use this new technology to bring you this site, and I’ve been posting about it everywhere. Here’s a quick breakdown of just what IPFS is, what it means, and what may happen in the near future as a result of this breathtaking technical accomplishment.

What is IPFS?
IPFS is an acronym which stands for “Interplanetary File System” and is literally designed to make information transportable between different planets.</description>

      <description>In late 2015, the International Journal of Oil, Gas &amp;amp; Energy Law published this essay.
Abstract:
The Environmental Protection Agency is tasked with providing a guide to automobile consumers which indexes the smog output of a particular car and compares that car to others. The ratings system used is complicated and accounts for zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs) as well as large trucks and everything in between. Unfortunately, this convoluted structure leads to a complexity which is simply not practical from the standpoint of the end user.</description>

      <description>Here is an article I wrote for Philosophy Now back in 2015. It deals with the late French philosopher, Pierre Hadot. He&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite philosophers, and I&amp;rsquo;m attaching a .PDF so you can have a look! The article appeared in Philosophy Now&amp;rsquo;s April/May 2016 issue (no. 113).</description>

      <description>Hi! It&amp;rsquo;s good to be posting again. Sorry about the old site going down! This is thrilling, though - the site you&amp;rsquo;re viewing is hosted via a decentralized internet platform called the Interplanetary File System (or IPFS).
My name is Thomas Dylan Daniel, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Texan writer &amp;amp; philosopher. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a technologist, and I read a LOT. As I work on the site and get everything updated, (and learn more about how to use Hugo) I&amp;rsquo;ll post tidbits here.</description>

      <description>There isn&amp;rsquo;t much going on at the present time. Formal Dialectics ought to be hitting the presses in the very near future, and there are a few articles that I&amp;rsquo;m working on to be released before too long. I&amp;rsquo;ll post here and update you when anything happens for sure!</description>

      <description>This summer, I&amp;rsquo;m working on a lot of stuff for work. So, I won&amp;rsquo;t have too much time to really delve into anything terribly complex. But, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick list of some things I plan to knock out over the next few months!

Feel free to make suggestions via Twitter or Facebook if you&amp;rsquo;re thus inclined!!!

      <description>Welcome to the Decentralized Internet.
In this life, there are few things more certain than change. This site, for example, used to be a Wordpress site hosted by a company with a server.
That changed recently.
Today, in fact.
Now, instead of being hosted by a single entity, this site is hosted by a &amp;ldquo;swarm&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;peers&amp;rdquo; (put in scare-quotes just to emphasized the novelty of the two concepts).
Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to follow along with the writings of a 21st century philosopher.</description>
