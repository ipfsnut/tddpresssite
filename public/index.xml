      <description>Hi! It&amp;rsquo;s good to be posting again. Sorry about the old site going down! This is thrilling, though - the site you&amp;rsquo;re viewing is hosted via a decentralized internet platform called the Interplanetary File System (or IPFS).
My name is Thomas Dylan Daniel, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Texan writer &amp;amp; philosopher. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a technologist, and I read a LOT. As I work on the site and get everything updated, (and learn more about how to use Hugo) I&amp;rsquo;ll post tidbits here.</description>

      <title>What Is IPFS?</title>

      <description>You may be wondering what on earth IPFS is. I’ve been very excited to use this new technology to bring you this site, and I’ve been posting about it everywhere. Here’s a quick breakdown of just what IPFS is, what it means, and what may happen in the near future as a result of this breathtaking technical accomplishment.

What is IPFS?
IPFS is an acronym which stands for “Interplanetary File System” and is literally designed to make information transportable between different planets.</description>

      <title>Formal Dialectics</title>

      <description>Formal Dialectics is my first serious philosophy book. It ought to be out later this year - I&amp;rsquo;ll post some review snippets and a blurb for it closer to launch.

Abstract:
Why do the attempts we make to explain the world around us fall short? Arguments for or against the existence of God, the question of free will, and even Principia Mathematica are all examples of explanations that look solid from some points of view, but which have serious weaknesses from other perspectives.</description>

      <description>In late 2015, the International Journal of Oil, Gas &amp;amp; Energy Law published this essay.
Abstract:
The Environmental Protection Agency is tasked with providing a guide to automobile consumers which indexes the smog output of a particular car and compares that car to others. The ratings system used is complicated and accounts for zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs) as well as large trucks and everything in between. Unfortunately, this convoluted structure leads to a complexity which is simply not practical from the standpoint of the end user.</description>

      <description>Here is an article I wrote for Philosophy Now back in 2015. It deals with the late French philosopher, Pierre Hadot. He&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite philosophers, and I&amp;rsquo;m attaching a .PDF so you can have a look! The article appeared in Philosophy Now&amp;rsquo;s April/May 2016 issue (no. 113).</description>

      <description>Further From Home is a collection of philosophical short stories. It has been live on amazon.com for several months now, after launching in February, 2018.

Blurb:
Further From Home is a collection of thought-provoking, puzzling short stories. The Zen purpose of the work is to provide the reader with a focus, in order to encourage awareness of the mystery, the magic, and the beauty of the world we share. Philosophical thinking is not only for libraries and scholars!</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Decentralized Internet.
In this life, there are few things more certain than change. This site, for example, used to be a Wordpress site hosted by a company with a server. It is still the primary website of an analytic philosopher, but everything else about it has&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;changed, recently.
Today, in fact.
Now, instead of being hosted by a single entity, this site is hosted by a &amp;ldquo;swarm&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;peers&amp;rdquo; (put in scare-quotes just to emphasized the novelty of the two concepts).</description>
