      <description>Hi! It&amp;rsquo;s good to be posting again. Sorry about the old site going down! This is thrilling, though - the site you&amp;rsquo;re viewing is hosted via a decentralized internet platform called the Interplanetary File System (or IPFS).
My name is Thomas Dylan Daniel, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Texan writer &amp;amp; philosopher. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a technologist, and I read a LOT. As I work on the site and get everything updated, (and learn more about how to use Hugo) I&amp;rsquo;ll post tidbits here.</description>

      <description>There isn&amp;rsquo;t much going on at the present time. Formal Dialectics ought to be hitting the presses in the very near future, and there are a few articles that I&amp;rsquo;m working on to be released before too long. I&amp;rsquo;ll post here and update you when anything happens for sure!</description>

      <description>This summer, I&amp;rsquo;m working on a lot of stuff for work. So, I won&amp;rsquo;t have too much time to really delve into anything terribly complex. But, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick list of some things I plan to knock out over the next few months!

Feel free to make suggestions via Twitter or Facebook if you&amp;rsquo;re thus inclined!!!

      <title>Welcome to the Decentralized Internet</title>

      <description>Welcome to the Decentralized Internet.
In this life, there are few things more certain than change. This site, for example, used to be a Wordpress site hosted by a company with a server.
That changed recently.
Today, in fact.
Now, instead of being hosted by a single entity, this site is hosted by a &amp;ldquo;swarm&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;peers&amp;rdquo; (put in scare-quotes just to emphasized the novelty of the two concepts).
Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to follow along with the writings of a 21st century philosopher.</description>
