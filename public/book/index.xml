      <description>Formal Dialectics is my first serious philosophy book. It ought to be out later this year - I&amp;rsquo;ll post some review snippets and a blurb for it closer to launch.

Abstract:
Why do the attempts we make to explain the world around us fall short? Arguments for or against the existence of God, the question of free will, and even Principia Mathematica are all examples of explanations that look solid from some points of view, but which have serious weaknesses from other perspectives.</description>

      <description>Further From Home is a collection of philosophical short stories. It has been live on amazon.com for several months now, after launching in February, 2018.

Blurb:
Further From Home is a collection of thought-provoking, puzzling short stories. The Zen purpose of the work is to provide the reader with a focus, in order to encourage awareness of the mystery, the magic, and the beauty of the world we share. Philosophical thinking is not only for libraries and scholars!</description>
