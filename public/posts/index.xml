      <description>Hey everyone, it&amp;rsquo;s only been a few days, but I&amp;rsquo;m still experimenting with IPFS here and we&amp;rsquo;re finding some issues.
The biggest single problem seems to be the difficulty of keeping the site running and pinned so that it is accessible on the network.
It is also difficult to tell precisely how to link directly to content, such as this post. If I wanted to publish this new post to Facebook, I would have to include the site URL and instructions on how to navigate to it.</description>

      <description>You may be wondering what on earth IPFS is. I’ve been very excited to use this new technology to bring you this site, and I’ve been posting about it everywhere. Here’s a quick breakdown of just what IPFS is, what it means, and what may happen in the near future as a result of this breathtaking technical accomplishment.

What is IPFS?
IPFS is an acronym which stands for “Interplanetary File System” and is literally designed to make information transportable between different planets.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Decentralized Internet.
In this life, there are few things more certain than change. This site, for example, used to be a Wordpress site hosted by a company with a server.
That changed recently.
Today, in fact.
Now, instead of being hosted by a single entity, this site is hosted by a &amp;ldquo;swarm&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;peers&amp;rdquo; (put in scare-quotes just to emphasized the novelty of the two concepts).
Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to follow along with the writings of a 21st century philosopher.</description>
