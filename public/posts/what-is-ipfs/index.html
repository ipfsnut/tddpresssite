I’ve been very excited to use this new technology to bring you this site, and I’ve been posting about it everywhere. Here’s a quick breakdown of just what IPFS is, what it means, and what may happen in the near future as a result of this breathtaking technical accomplishment.</p>

<p><br><strong>What is IPFS?</strong></p>

<p>IPFS is an acronym which stands for “Interplanetary File System” and is literally designed to make information transportable between different planets. While this capability is as yet a tad unnecessary, we’ll all understand the concept a bit better if we think about the difficulties posed by interplanetary web traffic.</p>

<p><br>1. Astronomical distances. We don’t want to run a cable from Earth to Mars to maintain an internet connection.
<br>2. Transmission time. Even if we did run said cable, the lag would be unfathomable. That’s just physics. Longer lines = higher latency, which end users experience as a time delay between the moment an action is performed and the moment  that action has results the user can see.</p>

<p><br><strong>Fine, but how does IPFS  combat these difficulties?</strong></p>

<p>Good question. IPFS is a truly decentralized network. What this means is that, as opposed to the traditional host/client model in which a ‘server’ distributes data across the network to however many machines happen to be requesting that data at a given point in time, we use a peer-to-peer model to distribute the data.</p>

<p>You’re probably already familiar with the concept of torrenting, in which case many users ‘share’ files with one another by allowing the network to request small chunks of them to distribute to other users. It’s a lot like that, but with IPFS no one has to turn anything on or run any additional program.</p>

<p>Files such as the ones you’re viewing in this website are available as a result of being broken into blocks, which are then disseminated across the network in a way that prioritizes the most-frequently-accessed files. Old content is purged from this hash after 7 days, but in the case of this website, I make sure to have a daemon open all the time on my computer so that it stays fresh, so to speak.</p>

<p>If I were to shutdown my computer, the website would disappear one chunk at a time.</p>

<p><br><strong>WAIT! I thought you said no servers?</strong></p>

<p>While it’s technically true that IPFS-stored content can stay in the network for days at a time, the system is not yet widely-enough adopted to store the amounts of data we need in the network. IPFS went live in 2015, and is growing rapidly. As more content providers (such as this site) switch from traditional paid hosting to IPFS, the system will grow exponentially more robust.</p>

<p>Ideally, what this will result in is a network-storage effect in which every user holds some amount of cached data - and can access all of the data held by others! So in effect, the network becomes the server.</p>

<p>It’s a little weird to think about. I’ve had a great time building this site, though, and I hope my quick rundown of IPFS has been helpful. If you’re curious, you can find more information on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CMxDNuuAiQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CMxDNuuAiQ</a></p>

<p>If I’ve missed something or left out an important tidbit, feel free to message me on Facebook or drop me a DM at Twitter.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
